summary:
  impact: "Created a recurring, high-engagement format that strengthened collaboration between product designers, brand designers and product managers and built a culture of shared problem-solving."
  myRole: "Initiated and facilitated the Design Open Hours format — designing the structure, running sessions, and establishing it as a self-sustaining practice within the team."
  challenge: "Existing meetings were update-driven and left little space for creative collaboration or early-stage problem-solving across disciplines."
  solution: "Introduced a bi-weekly, 60-minute open session where designers and product managers collaboratively tackled real challenges using a lightweight Figma setup — no slides, no prep, no hierarchy."

## Why We Needed a New Format

Our design and product teams used to meet weekly for updates.  
It was useful for visibility — but not for creativity.  
The format was presentation-heavy, with each team sharing progress while everyone else listened.  
There was little opportunity for discussion or shared exploration. Collaboration happened _after_ decisions, not during.

I wanted to change that dynamic.  
The goal wasn’t to add another meeting, but to create a space that felt energizing, open, and voluntary — where people could actually work together, not just report progress.

## Introducing “Design Open Hours”

That’s how **Design Open Hours** began: a bi-weekly, 60-minute session open to all product designers, brand designers, and product managers.  
It was built on three simple principles:

- **Optional participation:** people join because they want to, not because they have to.
- **No prep:** just show up with curiosity.
- **Collaboration over presentation:** the focus is on co-creation, not reporting.

Each session followed a clear but flexible structure:

1. **Collect challenges** — anyone can add a topic or design challenge to a shared Figma board.
2. **Vote** — the group decides which challenge to tackle.
3. **Brief** — the person who proposed it gives a two-minute context.
4. **Collaborate** — participants explore ideas individually or in small groups.
5. **Share results** — quick recap of what was discussed or designed.

Everything happens in **Figma**, using a simple template to guide the flow.  
I facilitated most sessions, but the team also runs them independently when I’m away — a sign that the format now belongs to everyone.

## What Changed

From the very first session, participation was high — even though it was optional.  
People enjoyed the format because it felt _productive_ and _fun_.

The impact showed quickly:

- Designers started working on topics outside their own product areas.
- Product managers gained a better understanding of design decisions.
- Collaboration between disciplines increased naturally.
- The team built empathy and common ground through shared problem-solving.

What used to be isolated project work turned into collective creative exploration.

## Why It Worked

- **Low friction:** no prep, no slides — anyone can join or observe.
- **Psychological safety:** open space, no judgment, all ideas welcome.
- **Shared ownership:** real challenges, real results, owned by the team.

The simplicity made it sustainable.  
It’s not just another meeting — it’s a recurring reminder that collaboration can be effortless and energizing when you remove barriers.

Design Open Hours proved that culture change doesn’t always require big initiatives — sometimes it starts with just one open hour, a blank Figma file, and a group of people willing to design together.
