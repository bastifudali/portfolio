## When Design Became a Legal Requirement

When the European Accessibility Act came into effect, accessibility stopped being “nice to have.”  
By June 2025, every digital product operating in the EU had to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards — or face penalties.

At Blinkist, our web experience hadn’t been built with those standards in mind. We had no dedicated accessibility team, tight engineering bandwidth, and a legacy front-end. Yet compliance wasn’t optional. It was now a business-critical goal.

So I took ownership of bringing our web product up to standard.

## From Legal Text to a Practical Plan

The first hurdle was simply understanding what the law required.  
I translated WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines into concrete, actionable tasks using the [**A11Y Project Checklist**](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) as a baseline.

From there, I created a detailed **requirements document** that scoped what parts of Blinkist.com were legally relevant.  
According to the European Accessibility Act, any page related to “contract formation” — even a free trial signup — falls under compliance. That included:

- Homepage and onboarding flow
- Pricing and secret deal pages
- Gift card purchase
- Login, signup, and account settings
- Legal and policy pages (Terms, Privacy, Cookie Consent)

Pages like the Help Center or Magazine were noted but deprioritized pending legal clarity.

## Tackling Compliance, One Fix at a Time

Once the scope was clear, I began implementing fixes directly — handling about 90% myself.

- Adjusted all color contrast ratios to meet WCAG 1.4.3 standards.
- Standardized focus states and fixed keyboard navigation flow.
- Rewrote misleading or missing alt texts for decorative and functional images.
- Add ARIA roles
- Fixed headline hierarchy (H1–H3)
- Updated vague “here” links in policy pages with descriptive text for screen readers.

Despite a limited dev window, collaboration was efficient: I partnered with engineers to review my code and implement the few fixes that were more complex due to the legacy codebase.

## The Outcome

- Blinkist now meets **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.
- All **high and medium priority accessibility blockers** fixed.
- **~90%** of total fixes implemented without requiring engineering resources.
