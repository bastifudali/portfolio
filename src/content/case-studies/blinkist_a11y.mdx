## When Design Became a Legal Requirement

When the European Accessibility Act came into effect, accessibility stopped being ‚Äúnice to have.‚Äù  
By June 2025, every digital product operating in the EU had to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards ‚Äî or face penalties.

At Blinkist, our web experience hadn‚Äôt been built with those standards in mind. We had no dedicated accessibility team, tight engineering bandwidth, and a legacy front-end. Yet compliance wasn‚Äôt optional. It was now a business-critical goal.

So I took ownership of bringing our web product up to standard.

## From Legal Text to a Practical Plan

The first hurdle was simply understanding what the law required.  
I translated WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines into concrete, actionable tasks using the **A11Y Project Checklist** as a baseline.

From there, I created a detailed **requirements document** that scoped what parts of Blinkist.com were legally relevant.  
According to the European Accessibility Act, any page related to ‚Äúcontract formation‚Äù ‚Äî even a free trial signup ‚Äî falls under compliance. That included:

- Homepage and onboarding flow
- Pricing and secret deal pages
- Gift card purchase
- Login, signup, and account settings
- Legal and policy pages (Terms, Privacy, Cookie Consent)

Pages like the Help Center or Magazine were noted but deprioritized pending legal clarity.

To make it actionable, I categorized every issue by priority:

- üî¥ **High:** blocks user access (e.g., missing form labels, no visible focus states, poor color contrast)
- üü° **Medium:** causes friction (e.g., wrong heading markup, inconsistent ARIA roles)
- üü¢ **Low:** polish or enhancements (e.g., prefers-reduced-motion support)

## Tackling Compliance, One Fix at a Time

Once the scope was clear, I began implementing fixes directly ‚Äî handling about 90% myself.

### Design and Content Fixes

- Adjusted all color contrast ratios to meet WCAG 1.4.3 standards (see before/after in the requirements doc, page 3‚Äì5).
- Standardized focus states with a clear blue ring (`outline-color: #0365F2`).
- Rewrote misleading or missing alt texts for decorative and functional images.
- Fixed headline hierarchy (H1‚ÄìH3) across the homepage, onboarding, and pricing pages.
- Updated vague ‚Äúhere‚Äù links in policy pages with descriptive text for screen readers.

### Engineering Collaboration

For more complex issues, I worked with engineers to:

- Add ARIA roles to modal dialogs and buttons.
- Fix keyboard navigation flow on sign-up and gift card modals.
- Adjust the reading order in onboarding pages to align with screen readers.

Despite a limited dev window, collaboration was efficient: design handled what could be done through content and CSS; engineering handled markup and structural fixes.

## Challenges Along the Way

Refactoring old code came with surprises.  
Some accessibility fixes broke visual layouts or triggered regressions in modals. Setting up local dev environments took hours each time ‚Äî slowing iteration.

But the biggest challenge was interpretation: accessibility laws are written for lawyers, not designers. Translating abstract standards like ‚Äúperceivable‚Äù or ‚Äúoperable‚Äù into real UI work required judgment calls.

Still, progress was visible and measurable after every iteration.

## The Turning Point

After two weeks of concentrated work, all üî¥ **high-priority issues** were resolved.  
We ran internal audits using **axe DevTools** and **Wave**, which confirmed WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all scoped pages.

No external agency was required.  
One designer and one engineer had achieved full legal compliance in less than a month.

## What Changed

- Blinkist.com now meets **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.
- All **high-priority accessibility blockers (100%)** fixed.
- **~90%** of total fixes implemented by design without requiring engineering resources.
