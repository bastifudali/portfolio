## A €60K Annual Saving in One Week

Blinkist had just decoupled from Go1 and simultaneously lost our in-house research team. Worse, we were still paying €60,000 per year for Chattermill, yet lacked clear insight into who actually used it or its true value. Faced with a pressing budget squeeze and no ready replacement, I took on the challenge to deliver a lean, self-made alternative—all in under seven days.

## Taking Charge: From Prototype to Production

My manager, enthused by “vibe coding,” encouraged me to explore a homegrown solution. I mapped out the core feature: fetch reviews from Apple’s and Google’s APIs, normalize them, and forward summaries to designated Slack channels. On Replit, I quickly sketched a UI using mock data—crossing the threshold into the project proper—before switching to live data.

## Secure and Automate: Productionizing the Prototype

The toughest moment arrived when tying together scheduled fetches, data processing, and Slack notifications into a single automated pipeline. After wiring up cron jobs on Replit and ensuring idempotent data handling, I added OAuth authentication and token rotation to protect our endpoints. Finally, the prototype earned its wings and was deployed securely to production.

## Lessons Learned: Building Lean, Building Right

Today, the team still enjoys a steady drip of user reviews—without Chattermill’s hefty price tag. We reclaimed €60K in annual savings and proved that tailored tooling can outpace generic platforms when scope is clear. The project reinforced that rapid prototyping (“vibe coding”) accelerates ideation, but production-grade systems demand rigorous implementation and security hardening.
