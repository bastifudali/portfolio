## A new chapter, with a blank canvas

When I joined Go1, I stepped into ownership of the design system just as leadership voiced a need to refresh the brand’s visual language—an initiative that would eventually evolve into a full rebrand. That created a rare opportunity: instead of iterating on legacy components, we could start fresh. We had the green light to build something future-facing.

## Moving fast, while staying aligned

Of course, a clean slate doesn’t mean a smooth ride. The questions came quickly: How do we structure the system? Can we transition incrementally while shipping new features? How do we coordinate across teams in Australia and Europe—and across design, engineering, brand, and product?

## The moment it clicked

Things accelerated when I teamed up with two engineers. With daily handovers between time zones, we built real momentum. Our informal “follow-the-sun” setup turned into a powerful rhythm. But the work wasn’t just about speed—it was about staying grounded. Instead of designing in isolation, we partnered with a product designer to anchor our system in real product needs.

## Not just tokens and templates

The hardest part wasn’t just building components—it was defining the right level of abstraction. We needed enough consistency to unify the experience, but enough flexibility to allow for brand expression and product context. Establishing solid foundations—design tokens for color, typography, spacing—was a turning point. From there, we built a system designed for real-world use, not just ideal cases.

## The payoff

We shipped a flexible, scalable design system that made collaboration between design and development smoother. Designers gained tools that made their work more consistent and efficient. Developers had clarity and confidence. And when the official rebrand rolled out a few months later, the system absorbed the change without friction. It did exactly what it was built to do.

## Passing it on

As the system matured, more team members joined the effort. Eventually, I handed over ownership to a Go1 designer. That handoff marked a shift—from building to evolving.

## What changed?

Even with a strong system, adoption takes time. But feedback was clear: designers loved the new consistency and usability. The design system became more than a tool—it became a shared language.

## What I learned

No two design systems are alike. The best ones are built with intent and participation. You can’t just ship components—you have to invite people in, make the system flexible, and design for both the now and the next.
