## Creating Space for Growth

For the Product and Design team at Blinkist, career development used to happen during manager 1:1s and performance reviews — conversations that often felt more evaluative than developmental.
When my manager asked me to take over career development for the Product & Design team, he saw a chance to create something more meaningful: a dedicated space for honest, non-judgmental conversations about growth.

## From Idea to Practice

I had led product designers before but hadn’t coached product managers or brand designers.  
To prepare, I joined the [ACE It Program by Autoris](https://www.autoris.com/pages/amc) and built a simple, human framework for coaching — one that emphasized curiosity, trust, and structure over formality.

I introduced the program through an open Slack post, inviting anyone to join.  
Coaching, I explained, wasn’t about performance—it was about gaining clarity, building confidence, and exploring goals with support.

Each session followed a light structure: **reflect**, **focus**, **act**.  
Participants could bring anything to the table — challenges, career questions, or just space to think.

## Building Trust and Momentum

Four of nine team members signed up for recurring sessions, choosing their own cadence — biweekly or monthly.  
Over time, patterns emerged: people sought clarity about direction, feedback, or next steps in their careers.  
My role was to listen, ask the right questions, and help them find their own strategies.

The consistency paid off.  
Coachees started initiating growth discussions in retros and 1:1s, and I began receiving spontaneous shout-outs in Slack and team meetings.  
Career conversations shifted from evaluation to exploration.

## What I Learned

- Structure, empathy, and trust are most important.
- Separating development from evaluation fosters psychological safety.
- Coaching works best when it’s flexible, personal, and consistent.
