## Rethinking Career Conversations

At Blinkist, career development used to happen during annual performance reviews.  
While practical, that setup left little room for honest reflection. Growth topics often got overshadowed by performance ratings and salary discussions.

My manager wanted to change that — to separate career conversations from evaluation — and asked me to take over career development for the Product & Design team.  
It was a chance to create something more meaningful: a space for open, growth-oriented dialogue that helped people see their progress and direction.

## Starting Without a Blueprint

I had experience leading product designers but hadn’t coached product managers or brand designers before.  
And while I’d mentored people informally, I wasn’t a certified coach.  
At first, that made me hesitant — would my support translate across different roles?

Instead of waiting to feel “qualified,” I decided to start small and learn along the way.  
To strengthen my foundation, I joined the [ACE It Program by Autoris](https://www.autoris.com/pages/amc), which gave me a structure and mindset to build on.

## Designing a Lightweight Coaching Framework

Before introducing anything to the team, I aligned with my manager on what success would look like: clarity and continuity, not formality.  
I explored frameworks from HR and design leadership communities, and distilled them into a few simple prompts:

- What do you want to get out of your role this quarter?
- What’s holding you back?
- What support do you need from others?

Each session became a 45-minute space to **reflect**, **focus**, and **act**.

I announced the initiative in our team meeting, clarifying that these sessions were not tied to performance or pay — they were about growth, not judgment.  
Four of nine team members signed up immediately, signaling curiosity and trust.

## Learning Through Practice

The first sessions were experimental. Some conversations flowed easily, others felt awkward.  
I learned that not every discussion needed a clear goal — sometimes listening was the most valuable thing I could offer.

Patterns started to emerge: lack of feedback, uncertainty about progression, unclear goals.  
I tracked these themes and used them to improve the prompts and structure.

Time management became the main challenge — balancing coaching with ongoing design work required discipline and boundary setting.  
But the more consistent the sessions became, the more value people saw in them.

## Building Momentum

I introduced a recurring rhythm: sessions every 6–8 weeks, with shared notes owned by each coachee to track progress.  
Soon, people started booking their own follow-ups and bringing up development topics outside of these sessions.

Some team members opted out — citing time constraints or uncertainty about the value — but those who joined became advocates.  
Their feedback and visible progress helped normalize coaching across the team.

Today, four of nine team members have active coaching tracks.  
I regularly receive positive shout-outs in retros and Slack channels — a small but meaningful signal that the practice resonates.

## Making It Part of the Culture

Over time, coaching became part of how we work rather than a side project.  
I integrated the format into onboarding and shared the templates with other managers who wanted to try similar setups.  
My manager considers this a success story in distributed leadership — showing how growth can be supported beyond formal management structures.

## What I Learned

- You don’t need certification to start coaching — **intention, structure, and empathy** matter more.
- **Separating development from evaluation** creates psychological safety.
- Coaching doesn’t need to be complex — it just needs to be consistent.

## Outcome

The coaching practice created a trusted space for reflection and growth.  
Team members report clearer direction, more ownership of their development, and greater confidence in pursuing their goals.  
For me, it reinforced that leadership is less about authority — and more about helping others see their potential.
