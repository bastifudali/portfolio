## A Vague Vision Meets a Concrete Need

Chefkoch’s leadership dreamed of “the Spotify of cooking,” but without a shared reference, product, design, and marketing teams lacked a unified frame of reference. Conversations spiraled into wireframes before the “why” was clear—fueling conflicting priorities and fragmented prototypes.

## My Role: From Sketches to Strategy

As Lead UX Designer, I was tasked with translating that high-level ambition into an artifact that would spark strategic dialogue, not just early UI explorations. I partnered closely with product managers to root our work in business goals, while gathering rich behavioral data from user research.

## Mapping Over Mockups

Rather than defaulting to polished screens, I championed a Customer Experience Map to illuminate the opportunity space first. Through iterative sketching workshops and feedback sessions, we aligned on key journey stages—from “first recipe cooked” to “hundreds collected” and ultimately “paying subscriber”—balancing depth with clarity.

## Bringing the Journey to Life

To humanize the diagram, I overlaid “Joel, a typical Chefkoch user,” and wove persona-driven storytelling into stakeholder workshops. This narrative approach transformed the map from a static diagram into a living story that teams could reference and build upon.

## Embedding the Artifact in Daily Work

Adoption was critical. I trained product “ambassadors” in hands-on sessions, equipping them to evangelize the map in planning meetings, stand-ups, and slide decks. Within weeks, cross-functional teams cited the CX Map in over 20 strategy sessions—solidifying it as our single source of truth.

## Lessons Learned: The Power of Visualization

By visualizing the opportunity space before diving into UI, we unlocked more creative, strategic solutions and avoided premature solutioning. Moreover, coupling a compelling visual artifact with persona storytelling and an ambassador network ensured it lived on as a dynamic tool, not a one-off deliverable.
