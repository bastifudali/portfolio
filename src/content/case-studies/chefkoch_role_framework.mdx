## From Ambiguity to Alignment

The Chefkoch design team was expanding quickly. UX and UI designers collaborated on the same products but without clear boundaries or expectations.  
Performance reviews often drifted into personal interpretation: everyone worked hard, yet no one was sure what “senior” meant or how to grow toward it. The lack of structure created friction, not because of poor performance, but because people simply didn’t know what excellence looked like.

That changed when, during one review cycle, several team members asked the same question:  
**“What exactly does growth look like for my role?”**

## Finding Our Own Approach

Creating a role framework sounds easy until you start comparing industry models. There are dozens of interpretations of what separates UX from UI — from overlapping hybrids to strictly divided disciplines. None of them fit perfectly.

So instead of copying one, I decided to **build our own**.  
I studied external references, including the _UserFocus article “The 8 Competencies of User Experience”_, which breaks down UX practice into skill areas like research, interaction, and collaboration. It provided a useful vocabulary — but we needed to translate it into Chefkoch’s context.

Together with the design leads, we mapped how our UX and UI designers actually worked day-to-day and which competencies mattered most for our product environment.

## Building the Framework

We defined four main competence areas — **research**, **interaction design**, **visual design**, and **collaboration** — and described what each looks like at three levels: **junior**, **regular**, and **senior**.  
Each description focused on observable behaviors and outcomes rather than abstract traits. For example:

- _Junior:_ contributes to user research with guidance.
- _Regular:_ plans and runs usability tests independently.
- _Senior:_ shapes research approaches and mentors others.

This first version immediately sparked discussion. To refine it, we ran **workshops and feedback sessions** with the entire design team. Every round brought sharper language and better examples. The toughest challenge was balance — keeping enough flexibility for individual strengths while maintaining consistency across roles.

## Applying It in Growth Conversations

The real test came once we started using the framework in **development talks**.  
Would it make those conversations easier or more rigid?

It turned out to be the opposite of rigid — it opened them up.  
Designers could point to specific examples of their progress; leads could identify concrete next steps.  
Instead of judging performance, we discussed **growth opportunities**.

Within a few months, the framework became part of every 1:1 and hiring conversation.  
It provided the structure that had been missing — and gave both designers and managers a shared language to describe what good looks like.

## A Living Tool

The framework didn’t end as a static document. It evolved with feedback and was later used for onboarding new designers and mentoring sessions. Other departments began referencing it as an example of how to define competencies clearly without bureaucracy.

## What I Learned

Defining roles is less about titles and more about **creating clarity and trust**.  
When people understand what’s expected of them, they can focus on growth rather than guessing the rules.  
That clarity became the foundation for scaling the Chefkoch design team sustainably — and for building a culture where progress feels fair, visible, and shared.
