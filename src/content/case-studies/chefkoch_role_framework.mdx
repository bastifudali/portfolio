## From Ambiguity to Alignment

The Chefkoch design team was expanding quickly. UX and UI designers collaborated on the same products but without clear boundaries or expectations.  
Performance reviews often drifted into personal interpretation: everyone worked hard, yet no one was sure what “senior” meant or how to grow toward it. The lack of structure created friction, not because of poor performance, but because people simply didn’t know what excellence looked like.

## Finding Our Own Approach

Creating a role framework sounds easy until you start comparing industry models. There are dozens of interpretations of what separates UX from UI — from overlapping hybrids to strictly divided disciplines. None of them fit perfectly.

So instead of copying one, I decided to **build our own**.  
I studied external references, including the [David Travis' article "The 8 Competencies of User Experience"](https://medium.com/@userfocus/the-8-competencies-of-user-experience-a-tool-for-assessing-and-developing-ux-practitioners-631770c6d2da), which breaks down UX practice into skill areas like research, interaction, and leadership. It provided a useful vocabulary — but we needed to translate it into Chefkoch's context.

Together with the design team, we mapped how our UX and UI designers actually worked day-to-day and which competencies mattered most for our product environment.

## Building the Framework

We defined four main competence areas — **research**, **information architecture**, **interaction design**, **visual design**, **writing**, **prototyping** and **leadership** — and described what each looks like at three levels: **junior**, **regular**, and **senior**.

Crucially, we used the same framework for both UX and UI design roles. This approach highlighted where the disciplines overlapped and where they differed, making it clear that both roles shared core competencies while having distinct areas of focus and expertise.

This first version immediately sparked discussion. To refine it, we ran **workshops and feedback sessions** with the entire design team. Every round brought sharper language and better examples. The toughest challenge was balance — keeping enough flexibility for individual strengths while maintaining consistency across roles.

## Applying It in Growth Conversations

The real test came once we started using the framework in **development talks**.  
Would it make those conversations easier or more rigid?

It turned out to be the opposite of rigid — it opened them up.  
Designers could point to specific examples of their progress; we could identify concrete next steps.  
Instead of judging performance, we discussed **growth opportunities**.

## Team Health Checks

We also conducted regular **team health checks** using the competency areas to identify collective strengths and gaps, helping us understand how to grow as a team rather than just as individuals.

## What I Learned

Defining roles is less about titles and more about **creating clarity and trust**.  
When people understand what’s expected of them, they can focus on growth rather than guessing the rules.  
That clarity became the foundation for scaling the Chefkoch design team sustainably — and for building a culture where progress feels fair, visible, and shared.
