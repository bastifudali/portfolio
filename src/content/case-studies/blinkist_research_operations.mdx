## When Research Suddenly Disappears

When Blinkist’s entire research team was laid off, the product and design teams suddenly had to run user research on their own. Overnight, structured operations turned into uncertainty. We risked losing our connection to real user insights.  
Rather than rebuild the old system, I set out to design a lean version — one that empowered everyone to do research, simplified the toolstack, and used AI to reduce friction.

## From Dependence to Ownership

At first, no one knew how to keep research going. Designers worried about quality; PMs were unsure where to start. Without researchers, our toolstack suddenly felt bloated and confusing — seven different platforms, scattered data, no clear owner.

Rather than rushing into fixes, I started by talking to the teams who relied most on research. I asked where things broke, which tools they actually used, and what they wished they could do themselves.  
That discovery phase became an audit of our entire research system. Together, we identified what was still useful — **Great Question** for testing, **Dovetail** for analysis — and what could go. It was less about replacing people and more about rebuilding confidence that research could still happen, just differently.

## Aligning Through Narrative Memos

To realign everyone, I borrowed a method from Amazon: the **narrative memo**.  
Instead of slides, I wrote a 6-page decision document that laid out the situation, options, trade-offs, and proposals for a new way of working. Everyone read it silently before our meeting — no presentations, no pitches.

That quiet reading time changed everything.  
People slowed down, thought critically, and contributed from a shared understanding.  
By the end, we agreed on a clear direction: simplify tools, embed research where work happens, and make insights visible to everyone.

## Designing the Lean Research System

The new setup focused on **clarity and efficiency** rather than coverage.

**1. Establish Dovetail as the knowledge hub**  
All qualitative research — interviews, usability tests, survey summaries — now lives in one place. Dovetail’s AI supports analysis, suggesting highlights and creating summaries. Manual review keeps quality high while automation lowers effort.

**2. Use Great Question for testing and recruitment**  
We replaced expensive external panels and unmoderated testing tools with Great Question, which lets us recruit participants from our own user base or a third-party panel as needed.

**3. Sunset unnecessary tools**  
Quantilope and UserZoom were cancelled, cutting costs and complexity. Typeform covers lightweight surveys; quantitative dashboards stay in FullStory and Periscope.

**4. Automate insight sharing**  
With Dovetail’s API and Zapier, new insights automatically post to Slack. Weekly AI summaries of customer feedback (“Voice of the Customer”) appear in shared channels.  
The principle: **bring insights to people**, not the other way around.

## Quantity Over Quality

One key shift was cultural: documentation used to mean long, polished reports that took weeks — and often never got written.  
We flipped that by adopting a “quantity over quality” rule.  
A short, imperfect note in Dovetail is better than none. The more data points we feed the system, the better its AI search becomes.

Now anyone can ask, _“What did users say about onboarding?”_ and get an instant answer, with links to real interviews and studies.  
The barrier to contributing research has dropped dramatically.

## Putting It to the Test

The real challenge came during the first product cycle without researchers.  
Teams had to run and analyze their own studies using the new setup.  
It wasn’t flawless — some inconsistencies appeared — but results spoke for themselves:

- Every product squad conducted and shared at least one study.
- Insights were discussed in Slack channels rather than hidden in decks.
- Time from question to answer dropped from weeks to days.

AI became an invisible assistant, guiding synthesis and helping non-researchers document findings with confidence.

## Scaling and Sustaining the Practice

Once the foundation worked, I focused on keeping it alive:

- Defined documentation standards and tagging conventions in Dovetail.
- Created a shared **Voice of the Customer** process to review KPIs and user feedback.
- Trained new joiners in lightweight research practices.
- Canceled redundant contracts and updated our ops budget accordingly.

What started as a stopgap became the new normal — a sustainable, distributed research culture.

## The Shift That Stuck

Research at Blinkist no longer depends on having a dedicated team.  
It’s a shared mindset embedded in how we work.  
Simplification and automation turned research from a bottleneck into a collective capability.

**Key takeaway:**  
You don’t need a research department to stay close to your users.  
You need clarity, simple tools, and the courage to make insights visible where people already work.
