## A system built for evolution

When I joined Go1, the company was about to refresh its brand identity—a change that would later grow into a full rebrand.  
That moment presented a unique opportunity: rather than patching up an aging design library, we could build a system that anticipated change.  
Our goal wasn’t just visual alignment. It was to create a **scalable design infrastructure** that could support growth, adaptation, and collaboration across time zones and teams.

## The foundation: design tokens as a source of truth

At the heart of the system were its **foundations** — a set of design primitives expressed as semantic design tokens for color, typography, spacing, and motion.  
These tokens weren’t static values in Figma; they were automatically **synced to the codebase**, ensuring every design decision could flow directly into production.  
This setup established a single source of truth between design and engineering — and allowed the visual language to evolve without friction.

## The component layer: where design meets code

The **component architecture** extended this philosophy.  
Each Figma component was mapped directly to its code counterpart through **Figma Code Connect**, creating near-perfect alignment between design intent and implementation.  
We used **Ark UI** as the foundation for our React components — a headless, accessible library that offered the right balance of structure and flexibility.

Not all components were created equal. Some required **strict consistency**, such as buttons and form inputs, where predictability was key to usability.

Others, like cards or banners, were intentionally **more flexible**, allowing teams to customize variants to accommodate product-specific requirements.

These explicit decisions around flexibility vs. constraint kept the system robust without becoming rigid.

To support this alignment, we established naming conventions and documentation that reflected the same hierarchy across design and code.  
Designers could trust components to behave as expected in production, and developers could rely on Figma as a precise representation of what they were building.

## Built for collaboration and speed

The system was intentionally lightweight and pragmatic.  
By focusing on real product needs first, we avoided overengineering and created a design-to-code workflow that scaled naturally.  
Daily asynchronous collaboration across Australia and Europe shaped the system into something that worked not just _in theory_, but in practice — for real teams shipping real products.

## The impact

The new system became the foundation for Go1’s rebrand and product consistency:

- Brand updates could be implemented in hours instead of weeks.
- Developers gained confidence and speed through clear, reusable patterns.
- Designers enjoyed a coherent set of tools that improved efficiency and reduced rework.
- Product teams across time zones spoke the same visual language.

When the rebrand officially launched, the design system absorbed the new identity seamlessly — no rebuilds, no downtime, no guesswork.

## From system to shared language

Eventually, I handed over ownership to an internal designer, marking the system’s transition from _project_ to _product_.  
It continued to evolve as more teams adopted it, shaping how Go1 designs, builds, and maintains experiences at scale.  
What started as a rebrand enabler became something more enduring — a **shared language** between design and engineering.

## What I learned

The strength of a design system isn’t in how many components it has, but in **how clearly it defines relationships** — between tokens, components, and the people who use them.  
A flexible foundation, clear alignment with code, and a balance between consistency and freedom made the Go1 Design System resilient to change — exactly as intended.
