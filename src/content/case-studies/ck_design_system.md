# How We Built a Design System That Transformed Our Product Development

## ðŸš€ Impact First

Our **Design System** started as a side project â€” yet today, itâ€™s a cornerstone of our product development process.

Hereâ€™s what we achieved:

- **Accelerated feature development:** faster design-to-code cycles
- **Consistent user experience:** across multiple products and touchpoints
- **Improved designer-developer collaboration:** shared language and tools
- **Reduced errors and rework:** thanks to purposeful component definitions

A project led by just **two designers and two engineers** reshaped the way our entire team works.

## The Challenge: Fragmented Design, Slow Progress

Before we built our design system, our workflow was messy:

- Designers worked in **Adobe XD**, while developers used a small, inconsistent **HTML/CSS library** in Storybook.
- Visual and functional inconsistencies multiplied as the product grew.
- The lack of a shared system meant each new feature required extra effort â€” slowing us down and introducing errors.

It was clear: we needed a unified system that would support **speed, scale, and quality**.

## My Role

As a designer deeply involved in the product workflow, I saw both the pain points and the opportunity.

I led the **design strategy**, drove the switch to better tools, and collaborated closely with engineering to ensure our new system would be both **usable and scalable**.

## The Journey

### 1. Starting Small, Thinking Big

We formed a lean team â€” **two designers and two engineers** â€” and treated the design system as a side project with a big vision.

### 2. Tooling Up: Switching to Figma

The first breakthrough was moving from Adobe XD to **Figma**, which allowed us to:

- Collaborate in real-time
- Build a scalable, component-based design library
- Better align design and engineering

### 3. Building the Library

We transformed our small HTML/CSS Storybook into a robust **Vue component library**, mirroring the Figma design system.

### 4. Defining the Right Philosophy

Instead of following Atomic Design, which we found too complex, we focused on two clear layers:

- **Foundations:** colors, typography, spacing, icons
- **Components:** fully self-contained elements with no cross-dependencies

### 5. Purpose-Driven Components

We defined components around **purpose and context**, not just appearance. This allowed designers and developers to:

- Easily select the right variant for each use case
- Avoid inconsistencies and redundant styling

### 6. Empowering Designers With Properties

By managing complexity through **component properties**, we enabled designers to work flexibly and independently â€” reducing engineering overhead and increasing design speed.

## The Final Outcome

âœ… A highly adopted **pattern library** used across design and engineering  
âœ… **Faster development cycles**, with reusable, reliable components  
âœ… A more **consistent, polished user experience**  
âœ… Stronger **collaboration** and a shared language between teams

Even as a side project, this initiative created a **lasting impact** on how we design and build products.

## Key Learnings

1. **Start small â€” scale intentionally**
2. **Build close designer-developer collaboration**
3. **Focus on purpose-driven components**
4. **Empower designers through great tooling and properties**
5. **Keep simplicity at the core of your system**

---

## Final Thought

A design system isnâ€™t just a library of components. Itâ€™s a catalyst for **faster, better, more consistent product development** â€” and it can start with a small team and a bold vision.
