# Forging a New Path: The Compass Team’s Journey to Strategic Clarity

## Team Formation

In early 2023, a diverse group of product managers, marketers, sales leads, IT specialists, SEO experts, and data analysts convened as the “Compass Team.” Their mission was clear: guide the organization’s quarterly strategic planning to achieve ambitious business goals. Yet at their first meeting, fragmented priorities and unspoken tensions made it difficult to chart a unified direction.

## Defining the Problem

Frustration surfaced when competing agendas clashed: marketing pushed for a high-impact ad campaign, product prioritized a major feature launch, and data demanded deeper research. It became clear that without a shared framework, the team risked duplicated effort and missed opportunities.

## Impact Mapping Workshop

To address this, two Agile coaches and I introduced an intensive two-day **Impact Mapping** workshop. By aligning business goals with user behaviors and potential deliverables—documented on a visual map—the team gained a common language and clear priorities.

## Establishing Outcomes

Armed with the Impact Map, we replaced long feature backlogs with **Outcome Tables**—concise statements linking desired impacts to measurable KPIs. We also adopted a “discovery vs. delivery” mindset, treating high-uncertainty ideas as experiments before full implementation.

## Measuring Success

By mid-year, transparency improved: stakeholders could trace every initiative back to a clear outcome, and mid-quarter check-ins focused on validated learnings rather than ticket counts. Initial results showed a 25% uplift in our primary ad conversion metric compared to the previous quarter.

## Scaling the Process

Today, the Compass Team follows a standardized quarterly rhythm: convene stakeholders, map impacts, prioritize outcomes, and commit to experiments. This process has transformed planning from a fragmented task list into a cohesive, outcome-driven strategy that resonates with executives and recruiters alike.
