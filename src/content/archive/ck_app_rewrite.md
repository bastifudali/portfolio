### Igniting Inspiration

When we set out, Chefkoch’s iOS and Android loyalists each craved something different—some wanted discovery, others a reliable cookbook at their fingertips. To tackle that, I dove into Google Analytics behavioral data and a qualitative Jobs-to-be-Done study to surface the three heartbeats of our users: Inspiration, Search, and Collect.

### Bridging Platforms

With insights in hand, the real test loomed: could one Flutter app satisfy both camps? I mapped primary tasks (Discover, Search, Cookbook) and secondary ones (Grocery Shopping, Cooking, Recipe Detail) into an information architecture that honored each need without duplication. The diagram on page 2 illustrates how we translated sticky user goals into feature zones.

### Guiding the Sprint

Because Inspiration carried the most uncertainty, I rallied engineers, product managers, and researchers for a five-day Design Sprint. By day 5 we had a clickable Flutter prototype, user-tested against our riskiest assumptions. That rapid cycle—sketch, prototype, test—ensured we built only what truly resonated.

### Crafting the Prototype

As Flutter was new to our team, I paired with engineers to ramp up rapidly—leading frontend development while also sketching UI flows. Together, we iterated the prototype into a high-fidelity build, validating not just interaction patterns but our emerging design system—complete with early design tokens.

### Facing the Unforeseen

Despite our strides, technical limitations in Flutter’s rendering engine forced the project’s cancellation mid-development. While disappointing, this pivot surfaced crucial learnings: the core of our product was crystal clear, and our fledgling design system was battle-tested for future endeavors.

### Harvesting Lessons

Though the app never launched, we emerged with two lasting wins: an evidence-backed feature set to build on, and a robust design system approach (thanks to our early embrace of tokens when few others did). These learnings now power Chefkoch’s product roadmap and inform every cross-platform endeavor that follows.
